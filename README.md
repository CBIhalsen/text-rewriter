# README for Python Tool to Rewrite AI-Generated Text
To create a Python tool that can rewrite AI-generated text, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python3 on your computer if it is not already installed.
2. Download or clone the repository containing the tool.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command in your terminal: `pip install nltk textblob`
4. Open the Python file containing the tool in your preferred code editor.
5. Import the `nltk` and `textblob` libraries at the beginning of the file.
6. Copy and paste the `humanize_text` function from the code snippet into your file.
7. Call the `humanize_text` function with the AI-generated text as the argument.
8. The function will return the humanized text.

Here's an example of how to use the tool:

1. Save the code snippet as a Python file, for example `text_rewriter.py`.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Run the command `python3 text_rewriter.py`.
4. The program will prompt you to enter the AI-generated text.
5. Enter the text and press enter.
6. The program will return the humanized text.

Here's an example of how the program will look like:

```
$ python3 text_rewriter.py
Enter AI-generated text: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
The amazing brown fox really jumped over the lazy dog.
```

The repository structure should look like this:

- README.md
- text_rewriter.py

To contribute to this project, you can fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

This tool was created using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and TextBlob libraries. Special thanks to the developers of these libraries for making natural language processing in Python accessible to everyone.
